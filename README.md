Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

This project builds a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing customer details such as age, job, marital status, and past marketing interactions.

ðŸ”¹ Workflow Steps:
âœ… Loading the Dataset â€“ Importing and understanding the structure of the data.
âœ… Model Training â€“ Training a Decision Tree classifier for prediction.
âœ… Model Evaluation â€“ Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
âœ… Decision Tree Visualization â€“ Interpreting the modelâ€™s decision-making process.

By the end of this project, we will have a functional machine learning model to help businesses analyze customer behavior and enhance marketing strategies.
